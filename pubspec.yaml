description: A new Flutter project.

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at http's://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - lib/special/base_citenco/asset/language/
    - lib/core/asset/image/
    - lib/special/base_citenco/asset/image/
    - lib/special/modify/asset/image/
    # thêm này ở builder
    - lib/special/base_citenco/modify/asset/image/
    # //////////
    - lib/special/modify/asset/image/member_card/
    - lib/special/modify/asset/image/logo/
    - lib/special/announcement/asset/image/
    - lib/special/blog/asset/image/
    - lib/special/location/asset/image/
    - lib/special/reward/asset/image/
    - lib/special/ecommerce/asset/image/
    - lib/special/warranty/asset/image/
    - lib/special/topup/asset/image/
    - lib/special/booking/asset/image/
  # - lib/special/topup/asset/image/
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: HelveticaNeue
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/special/base_citenco/asset/font/HelveticaNeue-UltraLight.otf
          weight: 200
        - asset: lib/special/base_citenco/asset/font/HelveticaNeue-UltraLightItalic.otf
          weight: 200
          style: italic
        - asset: lib/special/base_citenco/asset/font/HelveticaNeue-Light.otf
          weight: 300
        - asset: lib/special/base_citenco/asset/font/HelveticaNeue-LightItalic.otf
          weight: 300
          style: italic
        - asset: lib/special/base_citenco/asset/font/HelveticaNeue.otf

        - asset: lib/special/base_citenco/asset/font/HelveticaNeue-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: lib/special/base_citenco/asset/font/HelveticaNeue-BoldItalic.otf
          weight: 700
          style: italic
        - asset: lib/special/base_citenco/asset/font/HelveticaNeue-CondensedBold.otf
